These are my personal .bashrc and .vimrc files.  After years of losing them when I changed jobs
or whenever I lost a computer, I decided to take those files and just place them in github for 
me to be able to go back to whenever I wanted.  These are exteremly simple files.  By .bashrc used
to have all sorts of crazy crap in it, but this is what I've found I need on a day to day basis.

You're free to use this as a starting point, or as a compliment to your existing bashrc.  It works
so far in RHEL/CentOS 5,6,7,8 Ubuntu 12.04LTS to now, ArchLinux, SuSE and every other variant of Linux
I've had access to and time to play with.  It works well with Solaris 6 -> 10 and OpenSolaris 11.  
Lately I've been tweaking it to work with MacOSX and Windows10 bash shell.  I welcome input to these
simple scripts at @siliconjesus on twitter.
